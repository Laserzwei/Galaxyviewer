# Galaxyviewer

## Installation

run
/run Entity():addScriptOnce("mods/Galaxyviewer/scripts/entity/galaxymapper.lua")

Wait for it to tell you that it saved the file. The file should end up in the same folder as your clientlog.
*You will get a serious lagspike! Like literally 3+ minutes, where Avorion does not respond.*

Then execute galaxymapper.py (requires python3 and the "Pillow" module) and you will get a 2000x2000px representation of your Galaxies sectors.

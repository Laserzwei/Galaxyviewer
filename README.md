# Galaxyviewer

## Installation

Place the following files: /data/ folder, galaxymapper.py, modinfo.lua and this very file, into %Appdata%/Roaming/Avorion/mods/ (or the linux equivalent)

Then find and enable "galaxyviewer" viewer mod.

Enter in chat:
/mapgalaxy

Wait for it to tell you that it saved the file. The file should end up in the moddata folder:

../Appdata/Roaming/Avorion/moddata/galaxymapper/galaxymap.txt

Then execute galaxymapper.py (requires python3 and the "Pillow" module) and you will get a 4000x4000px representation of your Galaxies sectors.
